deliverr.py contains a function called picker(), which takes in two inputs, a map of tuples and a list of objects and returns a list of objects.

It was not clear the data types used beyond a map & list of objects so I took my best guess at what they could be while also trying to show my ability to use various data structures.

Input 1 is a map of tuples ('String', int), Input2 is a List of Objects w/ the atributes 'warehouse name' and {'item': int}

Within the file the 4 provided test cases are listed and commented out, if you'd like to add more tests you can add more below it, just follow the formatting or import the function into a test program.
